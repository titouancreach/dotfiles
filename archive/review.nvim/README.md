# review.nvim 🧐

Code review annotations for codediff.nvim, optimized for AI feedback loops.

Inspired by [tuicr](https://github.com/agavra/tuicr).

## Features

- Add comments to specific lines in diff view (Note, Suggestion, Issue, Praise)
- Multi-line comment support with box-style virtual text display
- Comments displayed as signs, line highlights, and virtual text
- Comments persist per branch (stored in Neovim's XDG data directory: `~/.local/share/nvim/review/`)
- Auto-export comments to clipboard when closing
- Export format optimized for AI conversations
- Send comments directly to [sidekick.nvim](https://github.com/folke/sidekick.nvim) for AI chat
- Commit picker modal to select specific commits to review
- Built on top of codediff.nvim

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.9
- [codediff.nvim](https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim)
- [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim)

## Installation

This plugin uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Pin to a tag to avoid breaking changes.

Using lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
  "georgeguimaraes/review.nvim",
  version = "v*",
  dependencies = {
    "esmuellert/codediff.nvim",
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
  },
  cmd = { "Review" },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>r", "<cmd>Review<cr>", desc = "Review" },
    { "<leader>R", "<cmd>Review commits<cr>", desc = "Review commits" },
  },
  opts = {},
}
```

## Usage

```vim
:Review              " Open codediff with comment keymaps (default)
:Review open         " Same as above
:Review commits      " Select commits to review (picker modal)
:Review commits SHA  " Review a single commit (diffs SHA^ against SHA)
:Review commits REV1 REV2  " Review specific revision range (skips picker)
:Review close        " Close and export comments to clipboard
:Review export       " Export comments to clipboard
:Review preview      " Preview exported markdown in split
:Review sidekick     " Send comments to sidekick.nvim
:Review list         " List all comments
:Review clear        " Clear all comments
:Review toggle       " Toggle readonly/edit mode
```

## Workflow

Open a review with `:Review` to see your staged and unstaged changes in a side-by-side diff, or `:Review commits` if you want to pick specific commits to review. The diff opens in a new tab with a file panel on the left.

Navigate between files with `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>`. Toggle the file panel with `f`. Press `t` to toggle between side-by-side and inline layout. Switch between the old (left) and new (right) panes with `<C-w>h` and `<C-w>l`. When you spot something worth commenting on, press `i` on the line and pick a comment type from the menu (note, suggestion, issue, praise). The comment renders inline as a box below the line with a sign icon in the gutter.

For multi-line comments, visually select the range first then press `i`. For file-level comments that apply to the whole file, press `F`. Comments on the left (old) side of the diff only show on that side, and same for the right (new) side.

Use `]n` and `[n` to jump between comments, `e` to edit one, `d` to delete. Press `c` to see a list of all comments across files and jump to any of them.

When you're done, press `q` to close the review. This automatically copies all your comments to the clipboard as structured markdown and shows a preview. Paste it into Claude Code, sidekick.nvim (`S`), or wherever you're chatting with an AI. The format looks like this:

```
1. **[ISSUE]** `src/api.ts:23` - This endpoint doesn't handle errors
2. **[SUGGESTION]** `src/utils.ts:~10` - The old implementation was cleaner
```

Lines prefixed with `~` refer to the old (left) side of the diff. Comments persist per branch, so you can close Neovim and come back to the same review later. Sessions auto-expire after 7 days.

    prev_comment = "[n",
    toggle_file_panel = "f",
  },
  codediff = {
    readonly = true,
  },
})
```

## Export Format

Comments are exported as Markdown optimized for AI consumption:

```markdown
I reviewed your code and have the following comments. Please address them.

Comment types: ISSUE (problems to fix), SUGGESTION (improvements), NOTE (observations), PRAISE (positive feedback)

1. **[ISSUE]** `src/components/Button.tsx:23` - Wrapping onClick creates a new function every render
2. **[SUGGESTION]** `src/utils/api.ts:~45` - The old implementation was cleaner
3. **[PRAISE]** `src/hooks/useAuth.ts:12-18` - Clean implementation of the auth flow
```

Lines prefixed with `~` (e.g. `:~45`) refer to the old (left) side of the diff. Range comments use `start-end` notation.
