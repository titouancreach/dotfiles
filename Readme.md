To install, and run ```install.sh```, it will create symlinks to the right files

Use `HAS_CODE=1 ./install.sh` when the host machine has vscode installed. It will install extensions and link the settings.json (mac only for now)

## Neovim 

Siver searcher (a.k.a Ag) is required to search through the code and for FZF, on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install silversearcher-ag
```

Install xclip in order to make the + register to work
```
